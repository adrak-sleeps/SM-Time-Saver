Nowadays, the biggest problem faced by us youngsters is that we spend too much time on social media even when we have hundreds of assignments piled up! So to help with this problem, I've made a Google Chrome Extension that helps you limit your time on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. 

Since I was at a loss of time (I started learning html/css/js two days after the ETE) I haven't yet made all the features completely and some parts are out of order :') 
But still it works like a timer for now, and I'll try to get over with this ASAP!

Up until now, it looks somewhat like this:

Before executing it as an extension, make sure to give it access to social media sites:

And a working demo can be seen here:

I still have many things to learn about extensions, and a lot of exploration on stack-overflow too!
So until then, see ya!
